      "Index 234806: Before long it was clear that Abdülkerim was less interested in stories of ordinary human frailty, pain, and transgression than in the sex lives, scandals, and domestic peccadillos of rich Istanbullus whom he hardly knew; one by one he focused on each girl rumored to have had sex before marriage, or even before her engagement, and I did not like this\n",
      "Index 234807: Perhaps this is why, by the end of the evening, having fallen into a contrarian frame of mind, I told Abdülkerim my own story, describing the love I’d felt for Füsun, but telling it as if it had all happened to some other rich idiot\n",
      "Index 234808: As I told the story of the young rich man, much admired in society, who had fallen so madly in love with a “shopgirl,” only for her, in the end, to marry someone else, I was so anxious to  \f",

      "Index 234826: So I would have to apologize, and being secure in the knowledge that I would never see her again, I could smile at Füsun and say one last indifferent good-bye\n",
      "Index 234827: As I walked through the door, Füsun would understand that this was to be her last glimpse of me, and perhaps she would panic, but I would elude her in a deep silence, as she had done to me for the past year\n",
      "Index 234828: I would not even say that we would never see each other again, but I would wish her well in such a way that she could not conclude otherwise and would thus be undone\n",
      "Index 234829: As I slowly made my way toward Çukurcuma through the backstreets of Beyoğlu, it crossed my mind that there was a chance Füsun might not be undone at all; it was possible she was perfectly happy, living in that house with her husband\n",
      "Index 234830: But if that was the case, if she loved that dullard so much that she would choose to live penuriously in that rickety house, then I would surely have no wish to see her again anyway\n",
      "Index 234831: Along the narrow streets, uneven sidewalks, and stairs, I looked through the half-drawn curtains to see families turning off their television sets and preparing for bed, or poor, elderly couples sitting across from each other, smoking their last cigarettes of the day, and it struck me on this spring evening, in the pale lamplight, that the people living in these silent backstreets were happy\n",

      "Index 235512: It was for this reason that Füsun studied the clock on the television screen to check if she’d adjusted her watch “perfectly,” and perhaps it was because I was looking at her with love that she smiled so happily-and not because she’d remembered Time\n",

      "Index 236117: The papers mentioned the censors only when they banned films much esteemed in the West, as with Lawrence of Arabia, categorically banned for insulting Turkishness, and Last Tango in Paris, trimmed of its sex scenes to make the film more artistic, and more boring than the original\n",
      "Index 236118: There was one partner of the Pelür Bar who’d been working at the board of censors for many years; Hayal Hayati Bey was a frequent visitor to our table, and one evening he told us that, actually, he believed in democracy and freedom of expression more fervently than any European, but that he could not allow those who would deceive our innocent and well-meaning nation to exploit the cinematic arts toward that foul end\n",
      "Index 236119: Like so many other Pelür habitués, Hayal Hayati also worked as a director and a producer, and said he’d accepted the board position so as “to drive the others crazy\n",
      "Index 236120: ”-a claim he punctuated as he did every joke, by giving Füsun a wink\n",
      "Index 236121: Hayal Hayati got his nickname (meaning “Dream”) from the Pelür crowd because he used that term so often when making his rounds of the tables, talking about the films he was going to make\n",
      "Index 236122: Every time he came to ours he would look soulfully into Füsun’s eyes, and he would tell her about one of his dream films, asking her each time for an “immediate and sincere” appraisal devoid of “commercial considerations\n",

      "Index 236126: According to Hayal Hayati, the Turkish film industry was free to do more or less what it liked, provided that films did not include lewdness or sex scenes, or unacceptable interpretations of Islam, Atatürk, the Turkish army, the president, religious figures, Kurds, Armenians, Jews, or Greeks\n",
      "Index 236127: Of course, he’d smile when he said it, because for half a century the members of the board of censors did not just obey the dictates of the state, banning any subject that made those in power uneasy, but had gotten into the habit of acting on their own agendas, banning whatever happened to annoy or offend them, and like Hayal Hayati, deriving considerable pleasure when using their power arbitrarily\n",
      "Index 236128: Hayati Bey told stories about the films he had banned during his time on the board with the relish of a hunter bragging of the bears he’d caught in his traps\n",
      "Index 236129: We laughed at his stories as much as anyone\n",
      "Index 236130: For example, he’d banned one film about the adventures of a hapless security guard on the grounds that it “degraded Turkish security guards;” and a film about a wife and mother falling in love with another man because it “insulted the institution of motherhood;” and a film about the happy adventures of a little truant was prohibited for “alienating children from school\n",
      "Index 236131: ” Unfortunately the first film Hayati Bey made after his term on the board ended was itself also banned, “and, sadly, it was a capricious decision motivated by personal matters\n",

      "Index 236133: The film, which had been very costly to make, was banned in its entirety on account of a dinner scene in which a man became enraged at the family dinner table because there was no vinegar in the salad, and the censors felt called to “protect the family, the foundation of society\n",
      "Index 236134: ” As he sat with us explaining how this scene and two other family quarrels, likewise offensive to the censors, had been taken in all innocence from his own life, it became clear that what had really upset Hayal Hayati was being betrayed by his old friends at the board of censors when they banned his film\n",

      "Index 236138: Hayal Hayati remained convinced that it was “a relatively good thing in the end” if censorship led only to the cutting of scenes deemed objectionable by the state\n",
      "Index 236139: For even a heavily cut film could be shown in the cinema, and if it still made sense, then you could make back your investment\n",
      "Index 236140: The worst possible outcome was an outright ban\n",
      "Index 236141: To prevent this disaster, the state was prevailed upon kindly to divide the censorship process into two stages\n",
      "Index 236142: In this first phase one would send the screenplay to the board for approval of the subject and the content of the scenes\n",
      "Index 236143: As was typical of all situations involving work for which citizens had to seek “permission” from the state, a complex bureaucracy of permits and bribery had developed, which in turn gave  \f",

      "Index 236148: He knew better than anyone how to make a script acceptable, rounding off its sharp corners, softening into innocence the harsh divisions between rich and poor, worker and boss, rapist and victim, virtue and evil, and offsetting the effect of any harsh or critical pronouncement that the hero might make at the end of the film-words likely to offend the censors but delight the audience-by the addition of a few bromides about the flag, the nation, Atatürk, and Allah\n",
      "Index 236149: His greatest gift was his flair for taking the sting out of the most vulgar and extreme moments in the screenplay: He would always find a light and witty way of returning it to the innocent charm of everyday life\n",
      "Index 236150: Even the big firms that gave regular bribes to the board of censors would entrust their screenplays to Daktilo Demir, even in the absence of unsuitable material, just so that he could inject into them the sweet aura of childish magic that was his trademark\n",
      "Index 236151: When we discovered how much we owed to Daktilo Demir for the most lyrical moments in those films that had so affected us the previous summer, the three of us-Feridun thought Füsun should come, too-decided to pay a call on the “Screenplay Doctor’s” home in Kurtuluş\n",
      "Index 236152: In a room filled with the ticking of an enormous wall clock, we saw the old Remington on which he had earned his legendary name, and we felt the same distinct magical aura as in the films he’d rewritten\n",
      "Index 236153: Demir Bey welcomed us graciously, saying that he would be delighted if we left our screenplay with him, so that if he liked it he could recast it on his typewriter into a version sure to pass the censors\n",
      "Index 236154: Showing us the stack of project files between the plates of kebab and fruit he had set out, he went on to disclose that the process would not be quick considering his vast workload; gesturing at his twenty-something twin daughters, sitting at the end of the enormous dining table, gazing myopically through their owlish glasses at the screenplays their father couldn’t find time for, he allowed, with paternal pride, that they had become “even better” than he was at getting scripts into shape\n",

      "Index 236165: The crow returned on other occasions, and again instead of flying off it just sat there, staring at Füsun from the corners of its bright, scary eyes to the point of intimidating her\n",

      "Index 239359: As personal museums were almost nonexistent in the 1990s, the collectors of Istanbul were secretly contemptuous of themselves and of their obsessions, and no less so of one another, whom they excoriated openly, the tirades only worsening if complicated by jealousy\n",

      "Index 239363: At the insistence of Hıfzı Bey, and in the hope of chancing upon a few reminders of Füsun that might have a place in my story, I attended a meeting of the Lovers of Collectible Objects Association, the first such group in Turkey, then recently established\n",

      "Index 235627: Unlike those intellectuals who deem it a solemn duty to deride the people and who believe that the millions of people in Turkey who talked of “sitting together” every evening were congregating to do nothing, I, to the contrary, cherished the desire expressed in the words “to sit together” as a social necessity amongst those bound by family ties or friendship, or even between people with whom they feel a deep bond, though they might not understand its meaning\n",
      "Index 235628: Here I display a model of Füsun’s apartment in Çukurcuma (this being the second floor of the building as a whole), which will, I hope, serve as an introduction to the eight-year span of my story\n",

      "Index 235634: Like everyone else at the table, I sat watching television year in and year out, but casting my eyes slightly to my left, I could see Füsun quite well without needing to turn toward her or move in the least\n",
      "Index 235635: This meant that while I was watching television I was able to look at Füsun for extended periods without anyone noticing, simply by moving my eyes\n",

      "Index 235637: If we were watching a film that had reached its climax, or some news story that we found particularly gripping, I took great pleasure in tracking Füsun’s expressions; in the subsequent days and months my memory of the images on the screen would merge with that of the expression on her face\n",
      "Index 235638: Sometimes at home I would first recall Füsun’s expression before the affecting scene that had provoked it (an indication that I missed Füsun and had gone too long without coming to supper)\n",

      "Index 235642: Some evenings, if the eating, drinking, laughing, and talking had proved particularly exhausting, Aunt Nesibe would say, “Come on, everyone, let’s sit on the divan,” or “Go relax and I’ll bring you coffee\n",

      "Index 236117: The papers mentioned the censors only when they banned films much esteemed in the West, as with Lawrence of Arabia, categorically banned for insulting Turkishness, and Last Tango in Paris, trimmed of its sex scenes to make the film more artistic, and more boring than the original\n",
      "Index 236118: There was one partner of the Pelür Bar who’d been working at the board of censors for many years; Hayal Hayati Bey was a frequent visitor to our table, and one evening he told us that, actually, he believed in democracy and freedom of expression more fervently than any European, but that he could not allow those who would deceive our innocent and well-meaning nation to exploit the cinematic arts toward that foul end\n",
      "Index 236119: Like so many other Pelür habitués, Hayal Hayati also worked as a director and a producer, and said he’d accepted the board position so as “to drive the others crazy\n",
      "Index 236120: ”-a claim he punctuated as he did every joke, by giving Füsun a wink\n",
      "Index 236121: Hayal Hayati got his nickname (meaning “Dream”) from the Pelür crowd because he used that term so often when making his rounds of the tables, talking about the films he was going to make\n",
      "Index 236122: Every time he came to ours he would look soulfully into Füsun’s eyes, and he would tell her about one of his dream films, asking her each time for an “immediate and sincere” appraisal devoid of “commercial considerations\n",
      "Index 236123: ” “That’s a beautiful idea for a film,” Füsun would say each time\n",
      "Index 236124: “When we make it you’re going to have to agree to star in it,” Hayal Hayati would reply, in the manner of a man who always acted instinctively and from the heart\n",
      "Index 236125: We were discovering that it would take some time for us to get our first film off the ground\n",
      "Index 236126: According to Hayal Hayati, the Turkish film industry was free to do more or less what it liked, provided that films did not include lewdness or sex scenes, or unacceptable interpretations of Islam, Atatürk, the Turkish army, the president, religious figures, Kurds, Armenians, Jews, or Greeks\n",
      "Index 236127: Of course, he’d smile when he said it, because for half a century the members of the board of censors did not just obey the dictates of the state, banning any subject that made those in power uneasy, but had gotten into the habit of acting on their own agendas, banning whatever happened to annoy or offend them, and like Hayal Hayati, deriving considerable pleasure when using their power arbitrarily\n",
      "Index 236128: Hayati Bey told stories about the films he had banned during his time on the board with the relish of a hunter bragging of the bears he’d caught in his traps\n",
      "Index 236129: We laughed at his stories as much as anyone\n",
      "Index 236130: For example, he’d banned one film about the adventures of a hapless security guard on the grounds that it “degraded Turkish security guards;” and a film about a wife and mother falling in love with another man because it “insulted the institution of motherhood;” and a film about the happy adventures of a little truant was prohibited for “alienating children from school\n",
      "Index 236131: ” Unfortunately the first film Hayati Bey made after his term on the board ended was itself also banned, “and, sadly, it was a capricious decision motivated by personal matters\n",

      "Index 236133: The film, which had been very costly to make, was banned in its entirety on account of a dinner scene in which a man became enraged at the family dinner table because there was no vinegar in the salad, and the censors felt called to “protect the family, the foundation of society\n",
      "Index 236134: ” As he sat with us explaining how this scene and two other family quarrels, likewise offensive to the censors, had been taken in all innocence from his own life, it became clear that what had really upset Hayal Hayati was being betrayed by his old friends at the board of censors when they banned his film\n",
      "Index 236135: If we were to believe what we were told, one night he’d gone out on a bender with them and ended up brawling in an alleyway with his oldest friend on the board, ostensibly over a girl\n",

      "Index 236137: But subsequently, to win approval for theatrical release and save himself from bankruptcy, Hayal Hayati, having still influence enough to win a second consideration, was obliged to remove every quarrel remotely demeaning to the institution of the family, with the exception of the one in which the brute of a son beat up his younger sister at the behest of his devout mother; with this editing, the film passed the board of censors\n",
      "Index 236138: Hayal Hayati remained convinced that it was “a relatively good thing in the end” if censorship led only to the cutting of scenes deemed objectionable by the state\n",
      "Index 236139: For even a heavily cut film could be shown in the cinema, and if it still made sense, then you could make back your investment\n",
      "Index 236140: The worst possible outcome was an outright ban\n",
      "Index 236141: To prevent this disaster, the state was prevailed upon kindly to divide the censorship process into two stages\n",
      "Index 236142: In this first phase one would send the screenplay to the board for approval of the subject and the content of the scenes\n",
      "Index 236143: As was typical of all situations involving work for which citizens had to seek “permission” from the state, a complex bureaucracy of permits and bribery had developed, which in turn gave \f",

      "Index 236145: There was a hardworking, well-liked Istanbul Greek known as Daktilo Demir, or Demir the Typewriter\n",
      "Index 236146: His manner of inoculating a screenplay so as not to offend the censors was to rewrite it, on his own famous typewriter, and in his own style\n",

      "Index 236148: He knew better than anyone how to make a script acceptable, rounding off its sharp corners, softening into innocence the harsh divisions between rich and poor, worker and boss, rapist and victim, virtue and evil, and offsetting the effect of any harsh or critical pronouncement that the hero might make at the end of the film-words likely to offend the censors but delight the audience-by the addition of a few bromides about the flag, the nation, Atatürk, and Allah\n",
      "Index 236149: His greatest gift was his flair for taking the sting out of the most vulgar and extreme moments in the screenplay: He would always find a light and witty way of returning it to the innocent charm of everyday life\n",
      "Index 236150: Even the big firms that gave regular bribes to the board of censors would entrust their screenplays to Daktilo Demir, even in the absence of unsuitable material, just so that he could inject into them the sweet aura of childish magic that was his trademark\n",
      "Index 236151: When we discovered how much we owed to Daktilo Demir for the most lyrical moments in those films that had so affected us the previous summer, the three of us-Feridun thought Füsun should come, too-decided to pay a call on the “Screenplay Doctor’s” home in Kurtuluş\n",
      "Index 236152: In a room filled with the ticking of an enormous wall clock, we saw the old Remington on which he had earned his legendary name, and we felt the same distinct magical aura as in the films he’d rewritten\n",
      "Index 236153: Demir Bey welcomed us graciously, saying that he would be delighted if we left our screenplay with him, so that if he liked it he could recast it on his typewriter into a version sure to pass the censors\n",
      "Index 236154: Showing us the stack of project files between the plates of kebab and fruit he had set out, he went on to disclose that the process would not be quick considering his vast workload; gesturing at his twenty-something twin daughters, sitting at the end of the enormous dining table, gazing myopically through their owlish glasses at the screenplays their father couldn’t find time for, he allowed, with paternal pride, that they had become “even better” than he was at getting scripts into shape\n",
      "Index 236155: Füsun was very pleased when the more buxom of the twins remembered her as one of the finalists in the Milliyet National Beauty Contest from years earlier\n",
      "Index 236156: What a shame it was that so few others did\n",
      "Index 236157: The same girl would deliver us back the screenplay, rewritten and polished specially for Füsun, and accompanied by kind words of admiration (“My father says this is a real European art film”), but by then three more months had passed\n",
      "Index 236158: Füsun met the delay with pouts and occasionally cross words, compelling me to remind her that her husband’s work had been just as slow\n",
      "Index 236159: Few opportunities to speak to Füsun privately, away from the table, occurred during my evening visits to Çukurcuma\n",
      "Index 236160: But toward the end of each evening we would go together to Lemon’s cage to make sure the bird had enough food and water and some squid cartilage to peck on (I bought this in the Mısır Çarşısı, or Spice Bazaar)\n",
      "Index 236161: But this was hardly ideal, and we had to whisper\n",
      "Index 236162: From time to time an easier opportunity would present itself: When she wasn’t spending time with the neighborhood friends she hid from me (mostly unmarried girls or newlyweds), or going with Feridun to film haunts, or doing the housework, or helping her mother with the sewing work Aunt Nesibe still took in, she would go by herself to paint birds\n",
      "Index 236163: She put it so prosaically, but I sensed the passion behind this amateur’s nonchalance, and her paintings made me love her all the more\n",
      "Index 236164: This hobby began when a crow landed on the ironwork balcony of the back room on the lower floor, a crow just like those that had landed on the balcony in the Merhamet Apartments: When Füsun approached it, the bird had not flown away\n",
      "Index 236165: The crow returned on other occasions, and again instead of flying off it just sat there, staring at Füsun from the corners of its bright, scary eyes to the point of intimidating her\n",
      "Index 236166: One day Feridun took a picture of the crow, a small black-and-white photograph I display here, which Füsun had enlarged for use as her model for a painstaking watercolor that I liked very much\n",
      "Index 236167: She continued with a pigeon that came to perch on the same iron balcony, and then a sparrow\n",
      "Index 236168: On nights when Feridun was not at home, before supper or during a long commercial break, I would ask Füsun, “How’s your painting coming along\n",
      "Index 236169: ” If she was in a good mood, she’d say, “Let’s go and have a look at it,” and we would go into the back room, which would be strewn with Aunt Nesibe’s sewing things, her cloth, and her scissors, and in the pale light of the chandelier we would study the picture together\n",
      "Index 236170: “It’s truly beautiful, very beautiful,” I’d say\n",

      "Index 236222: I had long since calculated that if Füsun were to run off with some director or famous actor she met at one of these bars, abandoning me and her husband, my pain would be astronomically greater than anything I’d suffered in the summer of 1975\n",
      "Index 236223: How much did Feridun understand the danger besetting us both\n",
      "Index 236224: He must have been at least vaguely aware of the commercial producers plotting to carry her off to a distant, depraved world, the hazards of which I was at pains to remind him-in veiled language-while hinting that the art film would cease to have meaning for me were Füsun to degrade herself by playing in some dreadful melodrama\n",
      "Index 236225: Back at home, drinking raki alone, in my father’s chair, I would wonder anxiously whether I had revealed too much\n",

      "Index 236229: When a journalist and self-described poet sat down at our table to inscribe a poem that had welled up from his innermost parts, and sweetly dedicated the inspiration to Füsun, I managed to ensure the timeless ode would not outlive that moment or have a single other reader by furtively instructing the elderly waiter Tayyar to toss it in the trash\n",
      "Index 236230: Later, when Feridun, Füsun, and I would find ourselves alone after such episodes, we would merrily compare notes, and, although each of us withheld details according to his or her purposes, we would laugh in genuine complicity\n",
      "Index 236231: After a few drinks, most of the film people and journalists and artists who frequented bars and taverns like the Pelür were given to weepy self-pity, but after only two drinks Füsun would become as cheerful as a child, as chirpy as a flighty girl, and on our visits to summer cinemas and Bosphorus restaurants, I sometimes imagined that the reason for her happiness was that the three of us were together\n",
      "Index 236232: Having long tired of all the gossip and wisecracks at the Pelür, I now seldom went there, and when I did it was to spy on those surrounding Füsun, and if possible, before the evening’s end, to extract Füsun and Feridun from the bar to drive with Çetin on a dinner excursion to the Bosphorus\n",
      "Index 236233: Füsun would sulk over leaving the Pelür early, but once in the car she’d have such a good time chatting with Çetin and the rest of us that I’d decide, just as I had in the summer of 1976, that going out to eat together more often would do us all good\n",

      "Index 236242: There were, of course, intervals when we’d fail to relish our pleasures-moments of tension or confusion between me and Füsun, anxiety that our film work would never begin-and these joyless spells would last for months until unexpectedly we would be driving around in the car together, and we would notice how delighted we actually were to be together, how close we had become and how much we loved each other\n",
      "Index 236243: In those days, the most popular place along the Bosphorus was Tarabya, with its line of crowded restaurants spilling across the sidewalks, and the tombala men wandering among the tables, along with the mussel vendors, the fresh almond vendors, the photographers who took your picture and brought back the developed shots within the hour, the ice cream men, the bands of musicians playing Ottoman music and the traditional singers who performed in most of the restaurants\n",

      "Index 236246: On our first excursion together we went to a relatively modest restaurant called Huzur (peace), which happened to have a free table, and which Tarık Bey had instantly taken to, because of its proximity to the flashy Mücevher Gazino next door, which meant that one could sit in the restaurant and hear the old Turkish songs being sung “from a distance and for free\n",

      "Index 237042: It was when I remembered Papatya’s former childish innocence that I could understand her now, just as I could recognize that childish innocence when I saw the tired, angry woman she had become\n",
      "Index 237043: Accompanied by a nonexistent orchestra-Feridun would fill in with clips from other films-she walked through the scene with the certainty of a model, with a hopelessness that seemed almost to rebel against God, and a lust for vengeance so great that we could not but share in her grief, recognizing that, rough as she was, Papatya was a jewel\n",
      "Index 237044: Dozing extras came back to life, and when the filming began even the waiters who had been bringing out the kebabs stopped to watch her\n",
      "Index 237045: In those years, every star held the microphone in a particular way meant to express their personality; that Papatya had found her own new and original way, which made her fingers look like pincers, was proof, according to one journalist I’d met at the Pelür, that she was destined for stardom\n",
      "Index 237046: Gazinos had stopped using fixed microphones, preferring the newer ones connected to long cords that allowed singers to mingle with the audience\n",

      "Index 237052: Maybe this was because journalists took notes\n",
      "Index 237053: Meanwhile, Feridun had begun to resemble the directors one read about: The chaotic speed of filming having robbed him of his childish air, in two months it was as if he’d aged ten years, and he now looked every bit the strong, resolute, and even merciless sort of man who always finished what he started\n",
      "Index 237054: That day also brought my first intimation that Feridun and Papatya might be in love, or at least involved in a serious relationship, though I wasn’t absolutely certain\n",

      "Index 237069: It was painful to remember that, less than ten minutes from the Peri Cinema, Füsun was sitting idle at home in Çukurcuma, even as I enjoyed watching the filming, which would go on all day, right up until the curfew\n",

      "Index 237106: ” First Füsun would pour cologne into her father’s hands, and Tarık Bey would rub it into his wrists with therapeutic purposefulness, inhaling the fragrance deeply, like someone recovering from shortness of breath, a relief renewed for the rest of the evening by sniffing now and again the tips of his long fingers\n",
      "Index 237107: Aunt Nesibe would take only a few drops, and with dainty gestures reminiscent of my mother’s, she would make as if she were lathering an imaginary bar of soap between her palms\n",
      "Index 237108: If he was at home, it would be Feridun who took the most cologne when his wife offered it, cupping his hands like a man dying of thirst, slapping it on his face as if intending to gulp it down\n",

      "Index 237131: Füsun’s answer had also served as a reminder of the war she had been waging against me for many years; in Aunt Nesibe’s looks, I could see that she was concerned for me as well as Füsun\n",

      "Index 237141: I used to buy Marlboro Lights from tombala men and the black market vendors in the backstreets, and I can recall a conversation with Füsun one night about how both Marlboro Lights and Samsuns were full-flavor cigarettes of a similar taste\n",
      "Index 237142: Füsun claimed that Samsuns made one cough more, but I said that as we had no way of knowing how many poisons and other chemicals the Americans put into their tobacco, it was possible that Marlboros were even more harmful\n",

      "Index 239363: At the insistence of Hıfzı Bey, and in the hope of chancing upon a few reminders of Füsun that might have a place in my story, I attended a meeting of the Lovers of Collectible Objects Association, the first such group in Turkey, then recently established\n",
